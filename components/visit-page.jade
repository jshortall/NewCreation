Every once in a while you might hear a new twist to an old secular song such as, \"Help, I Need Somebody\" by the Beatles or a spin-off of \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" appropriately renamed \"Sweet Home Up in Heaven.\" In all, our worship team creates a welcoming atmosphere that reaches people of all ages.",

Then we hear itâ€”\"Let's all stand and greet one another.\"  Ouch! We think you'll find NewCreation different.   Yes, we greet one another, but we don't believe in embarrassing our guests by asking them to raise their hand or to sign-up for anything.  Our desire is for you to feel at home.",
